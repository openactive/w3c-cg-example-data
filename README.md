# OpenActive W3C Community Group Example Data

This repository holds example datasets created and contributed by members of 
the OpenActive W3C community group and other organisations supporting the 
development of the OpenActive specifications.

The repository should be used to publish and share example data in a variety of 
formats. 

Over time we will update the repository to illustrate how these samples can be 
published in a variety of formats.
