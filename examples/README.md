Items to resolve:

* Use of `category` in flex example
* Mapping of Flex `channel` to Person may not be correct, all cases. E.g. second example may be an Organization
* `created_at`, `LastModified`, etc. Used in tracking items in paging spec but associated with creative works in Schema.org
* `id`s for items
