* This [list of activities](http://www.ymcaquebec.org/en/Find-an-Activity/List-of-Activities) mixes up activities and programmes

Common elements:

* Activities are a broader category than Sports
* Physical activities can be taken very broadly (see the compendium above) and these are perhaps less useful as opportunity data
* Activities might be grouped into broader headings, e.g. Martial Arts, Team Activities, etc
* Some Activities are "recognised" by specific bodies, e.g. for education purposes or as an indicator of significance/governance
* Some Activities have a governing body. Governing bodies may vary across countries/regions
